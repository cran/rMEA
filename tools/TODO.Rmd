### warning!
* Questa cosa: attributes(experiment2)=attributes(experiment) è male perché sovrascrive anche l'attributo "names"  che invece deve essere tenuto free. Sostituisci con structure(experiment2, "asd"=attr(experiment2,"asd"))

### easy stuff for next release

* Identify outliers in MEAlagplot()
* 'GET' functions, e.g. ~~getCCF~~, getMEA
* add a $rand object to _MEA_ class
* ~~all functions accepting _MEAlist_ objects now should accept a list instead and try to parse as _MEAlist_ internally~~
* Calculate % of simultaneous zeroes (when zeros are during at least 5s)
* clean code: debug comments, italian comments, old commented code
* diagnostic plots with 2 rows, on the second showing random section in great detail, e.g. 10 s of nonempty signal
* add outlier removal to the readme example
* export nowness % information
* tutte le funzioni on list in input cercano di fare MEAlist
* % of simultaneous zeroes


### advanced wishlist
* export long vector plots
* Implement peak picking algorithms results in $ccfRes
* **smart** confidence interval analysis for bootstrap
* dynamic window size!!!
* cross-validation to define a confidence band for each lag value, instead of mean (for MEAlagplots and group/bootstrap comparisons)
