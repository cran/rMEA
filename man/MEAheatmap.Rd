\title{Plot a heatmap of dyadic cross-correlations}
\usage{
MEAheatmap(
  mea,
  legendSteps = 10,
  rescale = FALSE,
  colors = c("#F5FBFF", "#86E89E", "#FFF83F", "#E8A022", "#FF3700"),
  bias = 1,
  mirror = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mea}{an object of class \code{MEA} (see function \code{\link{readMEA}}).}

\item{legendSteps}{integer. the number of levels used for the color-coding of the legend.}

\item{rescale}{logical. If TRUE, the color range will represent the minimum and maximum of the data. Otherwise the theoretical correlation range -1 to 1.}

\item{colors}{a vector of colors defining the plot scale.}

\item{bias}{a positive number. Allows to skew the color scale. Values larger than 1 give more widely spaced colors at the high end, and vice versa.}

\item{mirror}{logical. If TRUE, colors are mirrored for negative correlation values. This has effect only if \code{\link{MEAccf}} was run with \code{ABS=FALSE}}
}
\description{
Graphical representation of the lagged cross-correlations in time. Provides an intuitive description of synchronization dynamics.
}
\details{
The cross-correlation values are rescaled to be in a range from 0 to 1 before plotting.
